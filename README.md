# Programing and Scripting Project

## Research
### Background information about the Iris Dataset
The data set consists of 149 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). 

The dataset contains five attributes - petal length, petal width, sepal length, sepal width and species. 

## Preparation

There were 5 key libraries installed. Below is a list of the Python  libraries required for this project:


- numpy
- matplotlib
- pandas
- seaborn



## Investigation
 
```python

print(df.shape)

```
prints out (149,5) 149 rows and 5 columns 

####  Peak at the Data

```python
print(df.head(20))
```
prints out the first twenty rows 


### Summary stattistics
```python
print(df.describe())
```

The describe() is used to view some basic statistical details like percentile, mean, std etc. of a data frame or a series of numeric values.

#### Class Distribution
Letâ€™s now take a look at the number of instances (rows) that belong to each class. We can view this as an absolute count.
```python
print(df.groupby('class').size())
```


| Class           |  size  |
|-----------------|--------|
| Iris-setosa     |    49  |
| Iris-versicolor |    50  |
| Iris-virginica  |     50 |

dtype: int64

### Data Visualization

We now have a basic idea about the data. We need to extend that with some visualizations.

We are going to look at two types of plots:

Univariate plots to better understand each attribute.
Multivariate plots to better understand the relationships between attributes.

#### Univariate Plots
We start with some univariate plots, that is, plots of each individual variable.

Given that the input variables are numeric, we can create box and whisker plots of each


##### Box and whisker plots
Each horizontal line starting from bottom will show the minimum, lower quartile, median, upper quartile and maximum value of Sepal length, Sepal Width, Petal length and Petal Width of each species Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor. distribution of a continues variable across the categories

##### histrogram
A histogram of each input variable to get an idea of the distribution.

####  Multivariate Plots

##### Scatterplots matrix
This dataset examines sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width and then classifies the species.
Light blue indicates Iris setosa, pink Iris versicolor, and purple Iris virginica.
- Iris setosa has a large sepal width but small petal width.

- Iris virginica has a large sepal length and petal length.
- Iris versicolor sits between setosa and virginica much of the time.
```python
sns.pairplot(data=df,hue="class",palette="Set2")
```
